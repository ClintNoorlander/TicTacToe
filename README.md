I had initially used the Git Bash terminal, and only now found out that I can use GitHub to do all of it, so if there is anything I 
need to update or change, please let me know!

It was tough to understand git at first, but now I am very happy I understand it! I think that I had a difficult time because I was using bash from the beginning, so I had to learn how to command git as well as learn the prompts for bash. I like that I was able to make branches and explore without having to worry about making major changes that will mess up the main code. I ended up liking the work I did in all my branches, so I commited them to the main branch pretty much every time.

The majority of my branches I made were fro testing the shape of my board, and also what the messages display and where. I also decided to make a cpu to play against instead of a person, and that was very tough (I had to look up some examples for help with how to do that). I used my knowledge of function creation to make it all look nicer and more understandable, and I also tried to make the actual gameplay more intuitive than having to guess where a number will go.

I can see how using a version control system is a necessity for any kind of group work, and I don't think I would be able to work with a group without one now.
